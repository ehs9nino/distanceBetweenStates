# Distance Between U.S. Cities

## Project Overview
This Streamlit application calculates the geodesic distance between two selected U.S. cities. It provides a visual representation of these cities on a map and displays additional demographic information such as population density. The application is designed to offer insights into the geographical and demographic landscapes of U.S. cities using data from Simplemaps.

## Features
- **Distance Calculation**: Computes the geodesic distance between any two chosen cities in the United States.
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Utilizes Folium to render interactive maps showing the selected cities with a line representing the calculated distance.
- **Demographic Data Display**: Shows population and density data for the selected cities, enhancing the user's understanding of each city's characteristics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Folium**: For generating interactive maps.
- **Geopy**: For calculating geodesic distances.

## Data Source
The application uses comprehensive city data available from [Simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities). This dataset includes geographical coordinates, population stats, density, and more.
